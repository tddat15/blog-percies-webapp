          Like other successful endeavors in my life, I credit my old friend,
          Mel Brooks... he always gives me sage advice. When I told him that I
          was at loose ends since completing my last book, “Carl Reiner, Now
          You’re Ninety-Four,” he shouted, “Start a new one and call it, ‘Too
          Busy To Die.’” I thought it a smashing title and hopefully,“Too Busy
          To Die,” will also turn out to be a smashing read. Like other

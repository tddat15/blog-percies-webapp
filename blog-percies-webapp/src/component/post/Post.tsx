        Like other successful endeavors in my life, I credit my old friend, Mel
        Brooks... he always gives me sage advice. When I told him that I was at
        loose ends since completing my last book, “Carl Reiner, Now You’re
        Ninety-Four,” he shouted, “Start a new one and call it, ‘Too Busy To
        Die.’” I thought it a smashing title and hopefully,“Too Busy To Die,”
        will also turn out to be a smashing read. Like other successful
